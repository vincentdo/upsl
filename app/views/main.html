      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>         
        Hello there! This is the registration page for UPenn's second Summer League (of Legends). It will be a league, featuring a regular season and a final tournament. Players have until May 25th to sign up, and a live draft will take place on May, 30th. This league is currently limited to UPenn students (including incoming freshmen) and alumni.
      </p>
    
      <h2>League Details</h2>
      <p>
        The regular season will run from June 1 - August 24. Each team will have one or two games (the number depends on the total number of teams) against predetermined teams each week. These games can be played at their convenience over the course of the week. Weeks run from Saturday - Friday, and all games must be played and reported by Saturday 2AM (AKA late Friday night). Depending on the number of teams, a playoff schedule and finals will be determined.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tournament is meant to commemorate the end of the UPenn Summer League. There will be a verified sub list from which teams can draw subs if members of a team's roster are unable to play. A sub may not be of higher rank than the player he is filling in for. All players must be attendees of the university (or alumni). A standard bracket will be used for a total of 8 teams. There will be a loser's bracket after the semifinal to determine the 3rd place winner. The top two seeds will have byes. Seeds will be determined by final standings of UPSL. The tournament will be best of 1 up to the semi-finals and third place match, which will be best of three. Finals will be best of five, with a fifth game blind pick, if needed. The tournament will take place on campus and online, in Huntsman Hall, but up to members of a team will be allowed to play from elsewhere if the circumstances require it. The tournament will be online up to the finals, which will be live on August 24th. Teams that have players play on others' accounts will be automatically eliminated. The top four teams will receive prizes in accordance to Riot's prize system, and there may be extra prizes depending on participants' donations. Games will be live-streamed and commentated/casted by various members of the UPenn LoL club. 
      </p>
    
      <h2>Draft Details</h2>
      <p>
        8 Captains will be chosen based off of volunteers (and me begging people to captain if we don't have enough volunteers). Each player will receive a "Player Score" based upon the information given in this form (things like current division and KDA factor into this), which will determine preseason seedings. Captains will then be given this list, along with other player information the day before the live draft. The pick order during the draft will be determined based upon the captains' scores. All players will be picked and it will be up to captains to make substitutions during the season.
      </p>
   
      <h2>Prizes</h2>
      <p>
        Prizes will be delivered by Riot. More details to come on precisely what we will be giving out.
